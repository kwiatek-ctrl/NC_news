Hey there, before you start you'll need to create two enviroments and then connect them with the data base. To do so, we'll be using .env
- create a new file and name it .env.test
- create a second file and name it .enc.development

**Remember to mention those enviroments inside of the .gitignore (use .env.* to mention all .env enviroments)**
